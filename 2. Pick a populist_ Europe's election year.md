# 2. Pick a populist: Europe&#39;s election year

    Europeans like to complain that their elections do not offer clear enough choices. That won't be true in 2017. In the **Netherlands **in March, **voters **will choose among more than a dozen parties, including those **championing pensioners **and animal rights. Leading the **polls **is Geert Wilders's populist Party for Freedom, which wants to leave the **euro **and the European Union. France picks a president in **two rounds** in April and May; the National Front's Marine Le Pen, who also wants out of the euro, is likely to be in the **run-off**. Germany follows in the autumn, and **while **Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats are favoured, the **eurosceptic **Alternative for Germany will probably enter the **Bunderstag **for the first time. Italy's new **caretaker government **may call an election as soon as it amends the country's electoral law. If the populist Five Star Movement wins, it **vows **to hold a **referendum **on leaving the euro. Detect a **pattern**?
