# 1. Back stories: 2017 in film

    Scan the list and many **upcoming releases** will sound familiar. 
    "Resident Evil" returns for its final chapter in January; the next **instalment** of the "Fifty Shades" **franchise** will be released around Valentines's Day, **jostling for** attention with "The Lego Batman Movie". 
**    Remakes**, **prequels** and **spin-offs** abound. 
    Following her **appointment**--and **dismissal**--as an **honorary **UN **ambassador**, "Wonder Woman" will be hoping to **exercise her superpowers** on audiences and critics in June. But rather than **rehashing **familiar **narratives**, some films will offer new **takes **on old classics. "T2 Trainspotting" revisits Rent Boy, Spud, Sick Boy and Franco 20 years after the last film, where it's not about choosing "washing machines, cars, compact-disc players, and electrical tin-can openers" anymore, but "Facebook, Twitter or Instagram". Emma Watson, playing Belle in a **live-action** remake of "Beauty and the Beast", has asked for some **feminist** adjustments to Disney's story. 
    Familiar needn't mean boring.
