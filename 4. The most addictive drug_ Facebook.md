# 4. The most addictive drug: Facebook

The social-media giant has **defied** even optimists' **projections** of how big the 12-year-old firm could become. Today the company's **flagship** social network claims 1.8bn active monthly users. Facebook has attracted these **hordes **by engineering **features **that are highly addictive and relevant to their lives, so people keep coming back for more **hits**. Throw in the other apps it owns, such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and Facebook accounts for 30% of Americans' mobile browsing time, compared with 11% for Google and YouTube combined. Collecting data on users has helped Facebook become the world's second-largest advertising company on mobile devices. But Mark Zuckerberg wants to turn it into an even bigger part of the mobile ecosystem-hence the plans to develop Messenger and other messaging services into portals through which people can order taxis, communicate with businesses and so on. Being as useful as it is addictive could win Facebook even more friends.
