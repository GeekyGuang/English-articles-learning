# Year of the unicorn: tech controversies

If technology firms **reigned supreme** in 2016, they also **courted controversy**. Facebook was accused of **suppressing conservative **news sources and **hosting **fake stories that may have **swayed **some voters to support Donald Trump. Uber clashed with courts around the world, which **weighed **whether its drivers were employees or independent **contractors**, and whether Uber was a digital service or a transportation company **subject to** stricter regulation. And Airbnb came under **scrutiny **in cities like New York, which want to regulate how long people can rent out their apartments to tourists. These controversies point to the growing influence of tech firms in people's personal lives and the public **sphere**. They also raise the question of how responsible companies should be for the connections and content that their platforms host --their answer, unsurprisingly, is "not much". Expect many of these battles to **rage on** during 2017 and beyond.
